# Document Management System for Library

This project is a part of the Computer Engineering program at [Damascus University]. The aim of this system is to create a user-friendly document browsing experience within the library. This system heavily emphasizes the use of various design patterns to facilitate a robust and well-structured architecture.

## Features

- Composite Pattern: The composite pattern is used to create a hierarchical structure of documents. It allows the grouping of documents into folders, making it easier for users to navigate through the library's resources.

- Factory Method: The factory method pattern is implemented to provide an interface for creating documents. It helps in creating different types of documents while adhering to a common interface.

- Adapter Pattern: The adapter pattern is used to allow various document formats to be displayed uniformly. It ensures that different document types can be viewed seamlessly within the system.

- Singleton Pattern: The singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the library system. This helps in maintaining consistency and avoiding conflicts in document access.

- Proxy Pattern: The proxy pattern is applied to provide controlled access to sensitive documents. It allows for additional security measures for certain documents, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

- Builder Pattern: The builder pattern is used for creating complex documents step by step. It simplifies the process of assembling documents with different components.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11
- Design Patterns (Composite, Factory Method, Adapter, Singleton, Proxy, Builder)

## Usage
